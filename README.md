# Abstract
Sleep staging is critical for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. While traditional methods such as LSTM and Transformer models perform well in sleep stage classification, they encounter limitations in efficiently handling multimodal data, managing computational complexity for long sequences, and maintaining practical parameter sizes, which restricts their clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose SleepMamba, an efficient end-to-end framework based on selective state space modeling with optimized multimodal fusion. The framework consists of three hierarchical stages: first, multi-scale CNNs are used to extract coarse features from continuous multimodal polysomnography signals; second, a dual-axis epoch-level Mamba module integrates intra-modal and inter-modal representations within each epoch; and finally, a bidirectional Sequence Mamba captures inter-epoch temporal dependencies, followed by a feedforward network for sleep stage prediction. Experiments on the Sleep-EDF-78 and SHHS1 datasets demonstrate that SleepMamba achieves accuracies of 84.1% and 89.0%, respectively, surpassing Transformer-based baselines. Furthermore, the model reduces parameter count by 93.1% and training time by 87.2%, supporting its suitability for real-time and resource-constrained deployment.
